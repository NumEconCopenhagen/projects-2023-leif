# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

The goal of this project is to exam how the household maximizes their joint utility when choosing working hours and consumption. 

Through exercise 1 and 2 we solve the model in discrete time. 

In the first exercise we illustrate the relative difference in hours spent at home seen from the woman's perspective over varying values of alpha and sigma. 

In the second exercise we plot the log relative difference of hours spent at home against the log relative wage.

In the third exercise we do exactly the same as in exercise 2 but now in continuous time.

In the fourth exercise we run the regression with values from exercise 3 and afterwards minimize the squared differences of our regressors and the given values in the text. We minimize these to determine the alpha and sigma value that minimize the squared difference. Given our regression model the fit is not that good to the model in the paper. Like the paper we get a positive constant term and a negative slope but the values varies a lot. We are unsure of the economic interpretation as we havent been able to minimize the squared difference correct. 

We have not yet to complete exercise 5.
