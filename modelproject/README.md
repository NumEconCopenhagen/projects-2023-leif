# Model analysis project

Our project is modelled af the **Ramsey Model** and is about what effects $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have on the long run steady state.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelprojectFIN.ipynb](ModelprojectFIN.ipynb).

In our project we have set up 2 countries, and run the Ramseymodel on both of them. We assigned them  $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values, in order to test for the long-run steady state for different values. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
