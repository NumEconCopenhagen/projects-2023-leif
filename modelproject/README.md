# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey Model** and is about what effects $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have on the long run steady state.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelprojectFIN.ipynb](ModelprojectFIN.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
