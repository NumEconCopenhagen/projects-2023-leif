# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Consumer spending based on social status** and aims to look at how consumption is different based on the different social statuses in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We have gotten our data from **Danmarks Statistikbank**, and scraped datea using DST API. We have used the following Data:

1. **FU04** - Consumption based on consumptiongroups, socioeconomic status and price units
2. **PRIS112** - Consumer price index
